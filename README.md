## Overview
In this repository I have analyzed a telecomunications dataset of a company called TellCo. This project is part of 10 academy's training week 1 challenge. The project's objective is to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth investing.

## Scenario
You are working for a wealthy investor that specializes in purchasing assets that are undervalued. The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. You will analyze a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network.

## Approach
The project is divided and implemented by the following phases
1. User Overview analysis
2. User Engagement analysis
3. User Experience analysis
4. User Satisfaction analysis
5. Serving results of the analyses on a web dashboard
